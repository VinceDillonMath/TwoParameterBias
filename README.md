# TwoParameterBias

Current Goals:

Set up:
-- Use previous SMALL code (https://github.com/KareemSaysHi/SMALL2024-Elliptic-Curve-Coding) to set up database of elliptic curve families.
-- Reproduce some basic results to verify all is working, check biases of the promising families mentioned in their paper.
---- Can we compute longer running averages (servers)? Can we work to find similar families more ammenable to closed-form computation?
-- Implement Schoof's Algorithm to increase computation speed and probe conjecture 4.1.
-- Why is conjecture 4.1 hard to prove??

New stuff:
-- Find many families with potentially positive bias. Can we train a model to find more? What structure do families with positive bias have?
-- Can we find a TWO-PARAMETER family with positive bias? This would show that most one-parameter sections are families with positive bias.
Maybe look at families with factors of (T^2+T+1), (T^2-T+1), (T^2+1) as described in the paper.
--Any theoretical results?
